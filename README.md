# Cashflow #

Cashflow is a browser-based tool for managing personal finances, providing an overview of where the money is flowing.

### Technical Overview ###

Cashflow is a single-page web application that I created to experiment with certain technologies and software design approaches. My goal was to create a thin API service on the backend with a responsive MV* style frontend.

* Ruby on Rails is used to provide a minimal RESTful API
* Backbone.js is used for the interactive view layer
* d3js (d3js.org) is used for data visualization 
* Twitter Bootstrap is used for markup and styling

This is still very much a work-in-progress.
